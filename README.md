**Black and White Image Colorization**

---

**Introduction:**
Black and white image colorization is the process of adding color to monochrome images, recreating the appearance of the scene as it would appear in real life. This repository provides a simple yet effective implementation of black and white image colorization using deep learning techniques.

---

**Installation:**

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/black_white_colorization.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd black_white_colorization
    ```

---

**Usage:**

1. Prepare your black and white images: Place your black and white images in the `input_images` directory.

2. Run the colorization script:
    ```bash
    python colorize.py
    ```

3. Wait for the colorization process to complete. The colorized images will be saved in the `output_images` directory.

---

**Model:**

The colorization model used in this project is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. It takes a grayscale image as input and predicts the corresponding colorized version.

---

**Customization:**

Feel free to experiment with different architectures, loss functions, and training strategies to improve the colorization results. You can also fine-tune the model on your own dataset for specific applications.
